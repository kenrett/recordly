##Recordly

###This is an app that is nowhere neat complete but was done in the allotted time.

Recordly will be an application that allows for users to input and store their record collection. When complete, the user should be able to view their record collection, view a list of their "favorite" albums and/or songs, etc. Duplicate albums/songs should not be allowed. They should be able to "favorite" any of album/song/artist.

The site should have the following functionality:

User login
Search
Views:
Albums
Individual album view with songs
Artists
Songs
Favorites
Albums
Artists
Songs
Using any language or framework you prefer, please build an application using testing and best practices. Make the site have a mix of traditional CGI forms with page refreshes, as well as at least one each of an AJAX GET and POST (or some other modification type verb).
